React Router DOM enables client-side routing in React, letting your app have multiple “pages” without full page reloads.

Use <BrowserRouter> to wrap your app, <Routes> to define routes, <Route path="..." element={...} /> to map URLs to components, and <Link to="..."> to navigate between pages.

Supports nested routes, dynamic routes, and programmatic navigation.

Provides a smooth SPA experience, faster navigation, and state preservation.
